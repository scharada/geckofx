GeckoFX is a Windows Forms control written in clean, commented C# that embeds the Mozilla Gecko browser control in any Windows Forms Application.  It also contains a simple class model providing access to the HTML and CSS DOM.

GeckoFX was originally created by Andrew Young for the fast-growing visual CSS editor, [Stylizer](http://www.skybound.ca/stylizer).  It is now released as open-source under the Mozilla Public License.
